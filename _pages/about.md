My name is Fajril Ambia and I am a reservoir engineer at the Special Task Force for Upstream Oil and Gas, a government agency that oversees the oil and gas upstream industry in Indonesia. My primary interests lie in reservoir simulation and computational fluid dynamics. I have been working on various techniques in stochastic optimization and statistics to improve the quality of field development plans, which is now commonly referred to as data science.

Since 2016, I have been working on initiating business transformation in subsurface data management systems (SDMS). I have designed business processes and reviewed data collection methods for subsurface data. Through this work, I have gained knowledge and experience in new technologies in Artificial Intelligence and data science.

I hold a PhD in Petroleum Engineering from [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://www.itb.ac.id). My dissertation was titled "Development of Region-based Covariance Localization on Ensemble Kalman Filter (RCL-EnKF) for History Matching Process in Reservoir Simulation." Additionally, I have a bachelor's degree in Physics from Bandung Institute of Technology.

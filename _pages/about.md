Hello. My name is Fajril Ambia. I work as a reservoir engineer at Special Task Force for Upstream Oil and Gas, a government agency that oversee the oil and gas upstream industry in Indonesia.

I'm interested in reservoir simulation as well as computational fluid dynamics in general. I've been working on various techniques of stochastic optimization and statistics to improve the quality of field development plan. Nowadays we call it _data science_.

Since 2016, I've been assigned to initiate business transformation in subsurface data management system (SDMS). I designed the business process and review to collect the subsurface data. I learn a lot about the new technologies in Artificial Intelligence and data science.

As for my education, I have PhD in Petroleum Engineering from [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://www.itb.ac.id). My Dissertation title is _Development of Region-based Covariance Localization on Ensemble Kalman Filter (RCL-EnKF) for History Matching Process in Reservoir Simulation_. I also have a bachelor degree in Physics, also from Bandung Institute of Technology.
